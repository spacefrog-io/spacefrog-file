# spacefrog-file


##What is it?
A .spacefrog file is a file that you can embed into your repository to automatically deploy your repository onto spacefrog.io.  It's also a file that you can embed into your repository to enable others to deploy your repository onto spacefrog.io, and it's also a file that you can enbed into your repository to enable yourself to get paid for your code.  

##Why is it?
We built spacefrog because we're wierd.  You're wierd.  You want to work on YOUR projects, because they have value to YOU.  You're not building a business (or maybe you are) but you sure as hell don't want to deal with all of the things that come with that, so you embed a .spacefrog file in your repository, and you can begin to get paid by people using your software.  We built spacefrog because deploying software is too damn hard today.  By making the deployment dead-easy, we make it easier for you to get users for your work.  

##What kinds of apps work with the .spacefrog file?
Pretty much anything that can be hosted.  We're not limited to web apps, so you can host games, builds for Android ROMs, and more.  

##How the hell did you.....?
You'd have to lick the frog to find out.
